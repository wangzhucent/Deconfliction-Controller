# Deconfliction-Controller
This is a deconfliction controller for non-holonomic multi-agent UAV system following unicycle model within environment full of obstacles.

Files in Deconfliction-Controller/Motion Planning using non-holonomic RRT* to generate available path for UAV agents in environment with obstacles.

Files in Deconfliction-Controller/Controller, using the path generated in previous step, design the control strategy to avoid collision between UAV agents based on hybrid control protocol.

This code is for simulation in paper "Deconfliction Controller of Decentralized Nonholonomic System in Obstacle-Filling Environment Based on non-holonomic RRT and Hybrid Control Protocol" by Zhu Wang, Kunal Garg and Dimitra Panagou.
